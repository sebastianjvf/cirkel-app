					<h1>What is Cirkel?</h1>
					Cirkel is an app that connects you and the people around you, using the power of music.<br><br> 
					
					Cirkel shows you which songs the people close to you are listening to on Spotify and shares your musical taste with the people close to you.<br><br> 
					
					The attributes of these songs will determine your colour. Watch as your colour changes when you meet more people.<br><br>
					
					Connect your Spotify account to start.
